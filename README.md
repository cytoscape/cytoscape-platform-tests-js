# Cytoscape Platform Testing in Javascript

A web framework for running platform tests on Cytoscape Milestone releases for interactive sanity checks via CyREST. [Check out the example webapp](https://cytoscape.org/cytoscape-platform-tests-js/).
## NOTE: If you are using a browser other than Chrome, there may be issues communicating with Cytoscape CyREST

The webapp was created as a set of [reveal.js slides](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) and tested via the [Jasmine testing framework](https://jasmine.github.io/) but can be implemented in any script or application.

## Motivation

Cytoscape is intended to operate across multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc). On occasion, Cytoscape will exhibit unexpected behaviours on these platforms, due to differing file locations, UI implementations, installed Java versions, etc. Testing for these behaviours is a tedious process involving performing many Cytoscape tasks in the UI directly. We intend to automate this as much as possible to reduce the time involved for an individual tester to test a particular platform and configuration.

### API

The CyCaller class resides in `js/cycaller.js` and acts as the main communicator with Cytoscape. All calls to CyREST are made via a CyCaller instance. Here is a simple script for using CyCaller:

```python
const caller = new CyCaller()

# Clear the session
cyCaller.delete('/v1/session')

# Open a CX file
const url = 'http://chianti.ucsd.edu/~bsettle/galFiltered.cx'
cyCaller.load_file_from_url(url, function (suid) {
  console.log("SUID is " + suid")
  cyCaller.get('/v1/apply/layouts/circular/' + suid, function(){
    console.log("Layout applied")
  })
})
```

CyCaller currently provides the following functions:

```python

request (method, url, data, callback)
""" Send an XMLHTTPRequest as described by the _execute method
"""

_execute (http_method, endpoint, data, callback)
""" Internal HTTP request builder which propagates parameters to the request method
"""

post (endpoint, data, callback = console.log)
""" Execute an HTTP POST request to the given endpoint. This calls _execute with http_method="POST"
"""
  
put (endpoint, data, callback = console.log)
""" Execute an HTTP PUT request to the given endpoint. This calls _execute with http_method="PUT"
"""
  
get (endpoint, callback = console.log)
""" Execute an HTTP GET request to the given endpoint. This calls _execute with http_method="GET"
"""
  
delete (endpoint, data, callback = console.log)
""" Execute an HTTP DELETE request to the given endpoint. This calls _execute with http_method="DELETE"
"""

load_file_from_url (url, callback)
""" Load a network file from a URL. Currently only supports CX files
"""

get_network_suid (callback)
""" Fetch the SUID of the currently selected subnetwork and pass it to the callback
"""
```

### Full setup

To setup a local server and view the reveal.js testing slides that we have created, do the following:

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (4.0.0 or later). We use [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) to simplify the build process

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/brettjsettle/cytoscape-platform-tests-js.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the folder
   ```sh
   $ cd cytoscape-platform-tests-js
   ```

1. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```

1. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes
   ```sh
   $ npm start
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   $ grunt serve
   ```
   
1. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view the slides

   You can change the port by using `npm start -- --port=8001`.
   
   
1. To build the standalone webapp, run the build command via grunt
   ```sh
   $ grunt build
   ```
